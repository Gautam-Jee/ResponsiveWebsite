            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The customer buying journey isn’t a simple process of visiting a store
                and buying a product anymore. 73 percent of customers used multiple channels during their shopping
                journey. Odds are, your customers might make multiple pit stops along the way before actually making a
                purchase.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                They also realized the importance of linking their online store to social channels like Facebook and
                Instagram where they extend their customer service and reach new customers. “We’ve been able to see the
                tie between someone that’s on our Insta account and goes to our website and buys a product.” Creating
                this unified experience with customer service to match has allowed them to replicate the same connection
                they offered to customers in store, online.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">With ongoing industry changes and health regulations, it’s important to
                keep an open line of communication with your staff to make sure they’re always aware and prepared for
                any changes coming to your store.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                One way to make the best out of an uncomfortable situation is to be prepared for them. If masks are
                compulsory in your store, for example, consider offering masks for free to visitors that arrive without
                one, so you don’t miss out on a sale, and maybe transform a potentially negative situation into a
                positive one. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Personalizing your customer service is a trend that won’t be going away
                any time soon. 80 percent of customers are more likely to purchase from companies that offer some type
                of personalized experience or customer service. If you’re working with customers, a surefire way to
                create long-lasting relationships is to get to know them.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                If you’re running your store with appointments, train your staff to check up on customers that are
                coming in that day, so that they can show them products that might interest them or be ready with
                relevant upsells or offers.

                Giving customers exclusive offers isn’t the only way you can personalize their experience. Below are
                some simple ways your employees can take personalization into their day-to-day:

                Give your customers contactless options
                Focus on the customer in front of you
                Introduce employees and customers by name
                Celebrate your customers’ birthdays
                Go the extra mile
                Put yourself in your customers’ shoes.
